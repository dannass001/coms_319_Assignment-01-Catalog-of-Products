# coms_319_Assignment-01-Catalog-of-Products

1. Overview
This assignment serves as a foundational step in organizing ideas for the Midterm Project. While your
midterm project may differ, this assignment encapsulates many of the requirements expected for the
midterm.
You will download examples from the Bootstrap web page and select a template that aligns with your
vision for the Midterm Project.
Our focus is on creating a "Catalog of Products," inspired by the Activity during class where we
constructed a Catalog of Flowers. While the class activity wasn't intended for sales, it can serve as a
prototype for advertising various products. However, you are free to choose a different Bootstrap
example for your Assignment 01.
You will source images and text from the Internet or create them using original content. Exercise caution
with copyrighted material, ensuring compliance with privacy policies.
This assignment is a collaborative effort among team members. Sharing content with other teams is
prohibited.
Avoid using images and text from the class activity.
Be mindful that Bootstrap templates may include unnecessary code. Remove extraneous details to
tailor the project to its requirements.
